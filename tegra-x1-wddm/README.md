# Tegra X1 WDDM and NVK for Windows ARM64

An experimental Windows 11 GPU driver for the Tegra X1 (GM20B).
The kernel driver and board integrations share this tree with the Mesa NVK
Windows transport. Hardware verification started with Nintendo Switch Lite. [NVK Windows backend](../src/nouveau/vulkan/nvkmd/windows/)

The long-term goal is a complete native Vulkan implementation, verified
with version-appropriate VK-GL-CTS coverage and physical GM20B tests.
The current milestone is the Direct3D UMD and hardware DWM composition.

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Native Vulkan | NVK rendered an offscreen triangle on the GM20B and read back the expected pixels and guards with driver **0.1.0.87**. A Win32 preview displayed that readback. |
| Display adapter | **0.1.0.130** reached **Code 0**, completed GDI copies and displayed verified RGB bars through the GM20B VidPN and native scanout. |
| Windows desktop | A Direct3D UMD and hardware DWM composition are the next milestone. Direct3D device creation and continuous desktop refresh remain unresolved. |

The driver uses dynamically allocated shared memory with a **512 MiB**
adapter ceiling. Windows manages residency and budgets through VidMm.
