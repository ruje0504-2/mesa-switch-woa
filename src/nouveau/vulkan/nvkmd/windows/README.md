# Windows ARM64 NVK backend

This experimental NVK backend opens the Windows display kernel adapter
identified by the OS LUID. It uses KMT for VidMm allocations, GPU virtual
addresses, command submission and monitored fences. The matching GM20B
miniport must advertise the native-submit adapter ABI. The adapter,
allocation and submit headers in this directory are shared with the KMD.

Build from the Mesa checkout with LLVM-MinGW ARM64, Rust's
`aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm` target, Meson, Ninja and bindgen. Build
`mesa_clc` and `vtn_bindgen2` for the build host from this Mesa revision
and put them on PATH. Configure bindgen for the target Clang resource
directory and MinGW sysroot. Pass the versioned Windows SDK and WDK
Include directories for the KMT bridge.

```sh
python3 src/nouveau/vulkan/nvkmd/windows/build_icd.py \
  --out build/windows-nvk --cross-file "$WINDOWS_CROSS_FILE" \
  --cc "$ARM64_MINGW_CC" --clang-cl "$CLANG_CL" \
  --sdk-include "$SDK_INCLUDE" --wdk-include "$WDK_INCLUDE"
```

The SDK layout fixture runs at compile time. The build emits the ICD DLL,
a local ICD manifest, a controlled `test-kmt.exe` and a live adapter probe
`nvk-windows-check.exe`. Run the latter with the absolute ICD DLL path.
Use `--loader <absolute-vulkan-1.dll>` to exercise the public loader instead
of the ICD entry point. A registered manifest is required for elevated
processes, which ignore `VK_DRIVER_FILES`. On the .59 diagnostic baseline,
instance creation can succeed while loader device enumeration returns
`VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` and the full identity check exits 10;
that is not a native-GPU pass.

`test-kmt-shared.exe` checks shared storage, named objects and ownership with
controlled SDK KMT substitutes. `nvk-windows-shared-check.exe` tests live KMT
storage. `nvk-windows-vulkan-shared-check.exe <absolute-vulkan-1.dll>` tests
native Vulkan buffer/image sharing, GPU writes and readback after releasing
the producer, and re-export. The latter requires a registered ICD and an
active native-submit KMD. These live probes are not default build tests.
[Win32 memory contract and physical evidence](../../../../../tegra-x1-wddm/docs/VULKAN_WIN32_MEMORY.md)

Shared CPU-visible allocations use page-rounded byte counts and
`PAGE_READWRITE | SEC_COMMIT | SEC_WRITECOMBINE`, without large-page flags.
Failed `CreateFileMappingW` calls retain their Win32 error in the SDK's
`NTSTATUS_FROM_WIN32` encoding. The Vulkan boundary maps only memory or
pool/commit/quota errors to host OOM; unexpected access/privilege/parameter errors
return `VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` with the original code. The controlled fixture
injects thirteen section errors, verifies budget rollback, checks the exact
512 MiB boundary and tests 4 KiB/64 KiB/2 MiB GPU-VA alignment without
committing a 512 MiB Windows allocation. Successful small section requests
still use the real Windows API and verify write-combined mapping.

Native offscreen Vulkan and D3D11 runtime rendering at feature level 10_0
have physical passes on Switch Lite. Win32 Vulkan presentation, D3D runtime
shared-resource integration and sustained DWM composition remain in
development. [Matching KMD and hardware status](https://github.com/ruje0504-2/mesa-switch-woa/tree/main/tegra-x1-wddm)
