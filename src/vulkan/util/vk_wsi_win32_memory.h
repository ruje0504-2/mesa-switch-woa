/* Mesa-internal import of a runtime-owned WDDM allocation. These are not
 * Win32 external-memory handles and must never be passed to ShareObjects or
 * used with another device's paging queue. The owner retains the allocation
 * and executes each operation on the device that created/opened it.
 *
 * GPUVA reservations are process-wide. map_gpu maps the owner's allocation
 * into the supplied reservation and waits for its paging fence before
 * returning success. The owner records the whole reservation, releases it
 * before deallocating the runtime resource, and makes a later free_gpu a no-op
 * for a range already released. WDDM automatically releases allocation GPUVAs;
 * cached importer objects must not free a subsequently reused address.
 *
 * retain/release protect the owner context. The D3D frontend must finish GPU
 * use before destroying its runtime resource; importing does not change the
 * runtime's CreateResource/DestroyResource lifetime contract.
