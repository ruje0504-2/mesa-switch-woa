# Mesa Switch for Windows ARM64

Mesa NVK and a Windows 11 WDDM driver for the Tegra X1 (GM20B), based on
the Mesa Switch port. The current hardware validation was performed on
Nintendo Switch Lite (HDH-001).

The long-term goal is a complete native Vulkan implementation, verified
with version-appropriate VK-GL-CTS coverage and physical GM20B tests.
Windows desktop GPU acceleration is the current development milestone.
First light up and quickly verify desktop GPU acceleration through the
existing D3D UMD → Zink → NVK path. The final desktop UMD backend and the
DX9/10/11 game path will both use DXVK over the same NVK/KMD foundation.
DXVK integration remains pending; Zink remains the OpenGL compatibility route.

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Native Vulkan | NVK rendered an offscreen triangle and read back the expected pixels and guards with driver **0.1.0.87**. A Win32 preview showed that readback. |
| Display adapter | **0.1.0.130** reached **Code 0**, completed GDI copies and displayed verified RGB bars on the internal panel through the GM20B VidPN and native scanout. |
| Shared storage | **0.1.0.144** passes Vulkan Win32 buffer/image sharing, GPU read/write after producer-device release, and re-export: 32,768 payload words plus 512 guards match. [Scope and evidence](tegra-x1-wddm/docs/VULKAN_WIN32_MEMORY.md). |
| Windows desktop | **0.1.0.143** passes three native D3D11 runtime runs at feature level 10_0 after a Mesa barrier lifetime fix; **.144** also passes the 16,384-pixel RGBA/BGRA regression. D3D runtime sharing and hardware DWM composition remain pending. [Evidence](tegra-x1-wddm/docs/D3D_UMD_LIFETIME.md). |

The Windows NVK backend uses KMT for allocations, GPU virtual addresses,
submissions and monitored fences. The KMD uses dynamically allocated system
memory under VidMm with a **512 MiB** adapter ceiling.
