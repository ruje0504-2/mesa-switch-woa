# Mesa Switch for Windows ARM64

Mesa NVK and a Windows 11 WDDM driver for the Tegra X1 (GM20B), based on
the Mesa Switch port. The current hardware validation was performed on
Nintendo Switch Lite (HDH-001).

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Native Vulkan | NVK rendered an offscreen triangle and read back the expected pixels and guards with driver **0.1.0.87**. A Win32 preview showed that readback. |
| Display adapter | The **0.1.0.101** WDDM test build listed **Tegra X1 (GM20B)** under Display adapters with **Code 0**. |
| Windows desktop | Active WDDM panel presentation and DWM GPU acceleration are in development. |

The Windows NVK backend uses KMT for allocations, GPU virtual addresses,
submissions and monitored fences. The KMD uses dynamically allocated system
memory under VidMm with a **512 MiB** adapter ceiling.
