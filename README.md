# Tegra GPU backend

Native Windows ARM64 backend components for the GM20B in Switch Lite (HDH-001,
T214). Development and hardware evidence live in the single
[Vulkan status page](https://github.com/ruje0504-2/winx/blob/vulkan-test/docs/gpu-vulkan/STATUS.md).

The default build produces a kernel static library. `--probe` also builds a
System-class KMDF test driver and its SwitchFan PMIC bridge. These are **not**
a display miniport or Vulkan ICD. They keep the working POST display driver.

Build with LLVM and the official Windows WDK/SDK headers. `WDK_INCLUDE` and
`SDK_INCLUDE` denote their versioned Include directories; the script targets
ARM64 and the Windows 11 22H2 baseline, using WDDM 2.4 private-memory
callbacks. From the repository root:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/danfromtico/mesa-switch.git build/mesa-switch
git -C build/mesa-switch checkout 0ff52079ca9e9e837ed27eb95a8d239f439a1864
python3 drivers/TegraGpu/tools/build.py \
  --mesa build/mesa-switch \
  --wdk-include "$WDK_INCLUDE" --sdk-include "$SDK_INCLUDE" \
  --out build/tegra-gpu --probe
```

`TegraGpuCore.lib` contains WDDM resource/private-memory helpers, GM20B 4 KiB
page-entry and GPFIFO encoders, the unchanged mesa-switch report encoder, and
T214 power/clock control. The default target is **729.6 MHz**, with an opt-in
**1228.8 MHz** profile. C1 NA PLL calibration and the MAX77812 M1 voltage follow
the conservative Switchroot B01 CVB table and are checked by a GPCCLK counter.
OUT5 at 204 MHz is a separate power/reference clock. The KMDF probe uses a
private uncached arena, four mapped GPU pages and one channel to release two
FIFO semaphores with different values. It powers down afterward; it does not
load graphics firmware or execute shaders. The future WDDM adapter uses the
separate Dxgkrnl private-memory helpers; VidMm/scheduler integration is open.

The existing `LitePerformanceCheck.exe` is the UI for both clock profiles and
the combined readback check. The optional probe requires matching firmware
resources and the `SWITCH_LITE_GPU` build of SwitchFan. The build emits unsigned
SYS/INF files; generate Windows catalogs and sign the final files before
installation. Host tests and compilation do not establish a hardware pass.
Use a **CA:FALSE code-signing leaf** issued by the trusted development root;
do not sign SYS/CAT files with the CA certificate itself. Before installation,
verify the SYS signature and the INF/SYS catalog membership with Windows
SignTool (`verify /pa /c package.cat file`). A successful PnPUtil import alone
does not establish a valid Authenticode signature or an active device binding.

The firmware consumes `platform/t214_resources.h` through its WindowsDrivers
submodule. Build it with `-D SWITCH_LITE_GPU=1` to expose the separate ACPI
render node. Keep the existing POST display path during bring-up.
